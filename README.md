# EventSearchMobile

The largest programming project I worked on was an Android App titled "Event Finder". This was developed for native Android using Android Studio, Java and XML for the frontend functionality for the app and the backend API endpoints was implemented using Node.js which was hosted on Google Cloud platform. The node.js platform called the Ticketmaster API to retrieve event details.
This was a the largest programming project in terms of lines of code and rigorous testing and coding. This project was 100% contributed by me. 
In this app the user can search for events through a search form based on keyword, category, distance and location. In the search results that appear the user can favorite an event tap on the event to get its details, artists information in case it is a musical event and look at venue details. The user can even share this event on Facebook or Twitter. The user can also click on the artist's Spotify link which leads them to the artist's Spotify page. The user can favorite events and look for them on the favorites tab as well.
